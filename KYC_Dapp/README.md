#  Decentralized KYC dApp with AI + JuliaOS

This is a decentralized KYC (Know Your Customer) solution powered by JuliaOS, integrating AI agents for identity verification and multi-chain smart contracts for on-chain validation.

##  Purpose

To showcase how JuliaOS can enable high-performance, intelligent dApps by:
- Leveraging AI agents (face recognition, document scanning)
- Deploying across multiple blockchains
- Orchestrating operations using JuliaOS Swarm infrastructure

> Built for the [Superteam AI dApp Bounty](https://earn.superteam.fun/listing/ai-dapp-development)
